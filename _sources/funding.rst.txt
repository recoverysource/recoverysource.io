7th Tradition
=============

``Recovery Source`` is a "passion project," created from a drive to enable
struggling groups to reach those who still suffer. This project is fully
self-supported by voluntary contributions from project members who desire to
share such expenses.

``Recovery Source`` will remain completely free for all 12-Step programs that
find the service useful; no outside donations are accepted. Developers who join
this project are only permitted to contribute after one year of membership.
