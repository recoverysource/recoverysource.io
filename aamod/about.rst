About AA Mod
============

AA Mod (``aamod``) is a website solution for Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.)-related
website, with a focus on sharing meeting information in a fast and secure manner.

AA Mod is a Subtheme for `Hugo`_ with some extra documentation, scripts, etc.
Hugo is a website framework that builds statically-generated websites. These
static websites are immune to the vast majority of new vulnerabilities, meaning
your website will only ever have to change/update for content or design.

This added documentation walks a user through deploying this website and hosting
it using `Github Pages`_. If you have decided you want what we (`Area 63`_) have
and want to avoid major hurdles to get there, then you are ready to take
:ref:`certain steps<aamod-newsite>`.

Website Bootstrap
-----------------

The `Hugo Template`_ repository holds a copy of ``exampleSite/`` (from `AA
Mod`_) with customization done to help bootstrap a brand :ref:`aamod-newsite`
This lets you skip a lot of requisite knowledge and get straight maintenance.

AA Mod is a subtheme of `Mainroad`_. It can be used like any other theme with
the exception of requiring the Mainroad subtheme be loaded first. This parent
theme provides some great documentation which is not replicated here.
